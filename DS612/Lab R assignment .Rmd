## R Assignment 1

* In this assignment, we are going to apply some of the build in data set in R for descriptive statistics analysis.
* To earn full grade in this assignment, students need to complete the coding tasks for each question to get the result.
* After finished all the questions, knit the document into HTML format for submission.

### Question 1

Using **mtcars** data set in R, please answer the following questions.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
# Loading the data
data(mtcars)

# Head of the data set
head(mtcars)
```

a. Report the number of variables and observations in the data set.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!

dim(mtcars)


# Answer:
print("There are total of 11 variables and 32 observations in this data set.")
```



b. Print the summary statistics of the data set and report how many discrete and continuous variables are in the data set.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!
summary(mtcars)



# Answer:
print("There are 5 discrete variables and 6 continuous variables in this data set.")
```



c. Calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation for the variable **mpg** and assign them into variable names m, v, and s. Report the results in the print statement.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!
m <- mean(mtcars$mpg)
m
v <- var(mtcars$mpg)
v
s <- sd(mtcars$mpg)
s

print(paste("The average of Mile Per Gallon from this data set is 20.01 with variance 36.32 and standard deviation 6.02."))
```



d. Create two tables to summarize 1) average mpg for each cylinder class and 2) the standard deviation of mpg for each gear class.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!
#Table 1 -- Cylinder Class
cyl <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarize(AvgMPG = mean(mpg))
cyl

#Table 2 -- Gear Class
gear <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(gear) %>%
  summarize(MPGstdev = sd(mpg))
gear
```



e. Create a crosstab that shows the number of observations belong to each cylinder and gear class combinations. The table should show how many observations given the car has 4 cylinders with 3 gears, 4 cylinders with 4 gears, etc. Report which combination is recorded in this data set and how many observations for this type of car.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!
combo <- mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl, gear) %>%
  summarize(Instances = length(mpg))
combo
print("The most common car type in this data set is a car with 8 cylinders and 3 gears. There are total of 12 cars belong to this specification in the data set.")
```

### Question 2

Use different visualization tools to summarize the data sets in this question.

a. Using the **PlantGrowth** data set, visualize and compare the weight of the plant in the three separated group. Give labels to the title, x-axis, and y-axis on the graph. Write a paragraph to summarize your findings in this graph.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Load the data set
data("PlantGrowth")

# Head of the data set
head(PlantGrowth)

# Enter your code here!
g_w <- plot(PlantGrowth$group, PlantGrowth$weight, main = "Weight by group",
     xlab = "Group",
     ylab = "Weight")
g_w

gg <- ggplot(PlantGrowth, aes(x=group, y=weight)) + geom_point()
gg <- gg + labs(title = "Weight by Group", x="Group", y="Weight")
gg
```

Result:
Group trt2 contains the highest average weight and the most coincise 
interquartaile range between the three respective groups. The maximum 
weight observation in the dataset is found in group trt2.

Group trt 1 contains the lowest average weight and consists of 
a wide upper quartile range with a respective outlier. The minimum 
weight observation in the dataset is found in group trt1.

Group ctrl contains the widest interquartile range with an average weight
of ~5.5. This suggest observations are the most volatile with respect to weight
in group ctrl.

b. Using the **mtcars** data set, plot the histogram for the column **mpg** with 10 breaks. Give labels to the title, x-axis, and y-axis on the graph. Report the most observed mpg class from the data set.

```{r}
attach(mtcars)
hist(mpg,
     main = "MPG Histogram",
     xlab = "Miles Per Gallon (MPG)", 
     ylab = "# Of Observations",
     breaks=10)


print("Most of the cars in this data set are in the class of 15 mile per gallon.")
```



c. Using the **USArrests** data set, create a pairs plot to display the correlations between the variables in the data set. Plot the scatter plot graph of **Murder** and **Assault**. Give labels to the title, x-axis, and y-axis on the graph. Write a paragraph to summarize your results from both plots.

```{r}
# Load the data set
data("USArrests")

# Head of the data set
head(USArrests)

# Enter your code here!
#Scatter Plot Murder V. Assault
plot(USArrests$Assault, USArrests$Murder,
     col = "Red",
     main = "U.S. Murder V. Assault",
     xlab = "Assault Count",
     ylab = "Murder Count")

#Pairs Plot Murder V. Assault
pairs(USArrests[,1:2],
      col="Red",
      labels = c("Murder by State", "Assault by State"),
      main = "Pairs plot comparing U.S Murder & Assault")
```

Result:

=> Enter your result here!

***
Assessing the Pairs plot. The majority of states contain low rates of murder and
assault. However, there remains a significant number of states with high rates
of both.A positive linear relationship is present between assault and murder in the 
United States.


### Question 3

Download the housing data set from www.jaredlander.com and find out what explains the housing prices in New York City.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Load and clean the housing data set
download.file(url='https://www.jaredlander.com/data/housing.csv',
              destfile='data/housing.csv', mode='wb')
housingData <- read.csv('~/Desktop/housing.csv')
housingData <- subset(housingData, 
                      select = c("Neighborhood", "Market.Value.per.SqFt", "Boro", "Year.Built"))
housingData <- na.omit(housingData)                   
```

a. Create your own descriptive statistics and aggregation tables to summarize the data set and find any meaningful results between different variables in the data set.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
# Head of the cleaned data set
head(housingData)

# Enter your code here!
#Avg Market Value per Sqft by neighborhood
housingData %>%
   group_by(Neighborhood) %>%
   summarize(Avg_MktVal_Sqft = round(mean(Market.Value.per.SqFt), digits=2),
             Stdev_MktVal_Sqft = round(sd(Market.Value.per.SqFt), digits=2),
             Var_MktVal_Sqft = round(var(Market.Value.per.SqFt), digits=2))
  
library(tidyverse)
#Avg + standard deviation of house year built by neighborhood
hd1 <- housingData %>% drop_na(Year.Built)

hd1 %>% 
  group_by(Neighborhood) %>%
  summarize(Avg_House_Age= round(mean(Year.Built)), 
            Stdev_House_age = round(sd(Year.Built), digits=2),
            Var_House_age = round(var(Year.Built), digits=2))


#Prominent neighborhood and boro by listings
Hd2 <- housingData %>%
  group_by(Boro, Neighborhood) %>%
  summarize(Listings = length(Year.Built))

Hd2 <- Hd2[order(Hd2$Listings,decreasing=TRUE),]
Hd2

#Top Neighborhood in each Boro by listings
Hd2 %>% slice(1)

```


b. Create multiple plots to demonstrates the correlations between different variables. Remember to label all axes and give title to each graph.

```{r}
# Enter your code here!
#Pair Plot to determine relationship 
pairs(housingData[, c(2,4)],
      col = "Red",
      labels = c("Market Val per sqft", "Year of House Build"),
      main="Year Built V. Market Val per sqft")  #Stationary relationship

#Distribution of house ages
hist(x= housingData$Year.Built,
     xlab = "Year of House Build",
     ylab = "Count") 


#Scatter plot comparing age of home and  market value per square feet for the listed Boros
g <- ggplot(housingData, aes(x=housingData$Year.Built, y=housingData$Market.Value.per.SqFt)) + geom_point()
g <- g + geom_point(aes(color=Boro))
g <- g + labs(title="House Age and Market Value per Sqft Scatter Plot",
              x = "Year of House Build",
              y = "Market Value per Sqft")
g

#Listings per Boro
ggplot(Hd2, aes(y=Listings, x=Boro)) + geom_point()

#Box + Whisker plot 
Bw <- ggplot(housingData, aes(y=Year.Built, x=Boro)) + geom_boxplot()
Bw <- Bw + labs(title="Boro V. House Age Box-Whisker Plot",
                x="Boro",
                y="Market Value per Sqft")
Bw

Bw1 <- ggplot(housingData, aes(y=Market.Value.per.SqFt, x=Boro)) + geom_boxplot()
Bw1 <- Bw1 + labs(title = "Borro V. Sqft Market Value Box-Whisker Plot",
                  x = "Boro",
                  y="Market Value per Sqft")
Bw1


```

In this exercise I utilized R programming language to perform data manipulation,
statistics, and visualization. I leveraged a variety of statistical and
visual packages such as dplyr and ggplot to create insightful interpretation
of data and detailed graphics. The exercise reinforced, strengthened, and added 
to my prior R programming knowledge.
